available memory free to use in real mode - conventional memory

conventional memory limit address 0x9F000 - 636Kb convetional memory necessary for system

conventional memory free start address 0x500
conventional memory free end address 0x9F000

binary images address layout:
	stage_zero start address - 0x7C00
	stage_zero end   address - 0x7DFF
	size in bytes - 512 - 0x200

	stage_one start address - 0x500
	stage_one end   address - 0x26FF
	size in bytes - 8704 -    0x2200

heap region layout:
	heap start address - 0x17E00
	heap end   address - 0x49DFF
	size in bytes - 204800 - 0x32000

stack region layout:
	stack top       address - 0x9F000
	stack bottom    address - 0x49E00
	size in bytes - 348672 - 0x55200

OBS: when stage_one is loaded and has control, it can do itself task ignoring stage_zero on memory
	 kernel limit size override stage_zero bytes code
